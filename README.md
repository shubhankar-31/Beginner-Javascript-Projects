# Beginner-Javascript-Projects
This repository conatins 15 projects at the Beginner level, with a central focus on core JavaScript principles. 
I am currently studying through the instructional resource provided in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4

Furthermore, I have independently implemented the entirety of the JavaScript functionality within these projects, ensuring adherence to production-level syntax and code structure standards.
